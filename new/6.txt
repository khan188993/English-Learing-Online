7:08
feet and started crying you are my god

7:27
your sister-in-law is no longer in this world christ sam told christ everything that has
7:33
happened to him christ decides to give sam what is rightfully his then he bought all the shares of alice
7:41
and harry's company and then he made sam owner of these companies again
7:46
when alice and harry found out about this they were regretful
7:51
they went to sam's house to apologize brother please forgive us we made a
7:58
grave mistake we never understood your kindness i can forgive you anytime
8:04
but the person worked hard to provide you everything as a father and who took care of his brother as if
8:11
they are his own son that brother will never forgive because you didn't care
8:17
whether he survives or not and christ this is very clear now they have come to
8:22
apologize because they are not doing well but if they become rich again they might start changing their colors
8:28
again but sam had not forgotten the promise that he gave to his mother sam gave them
8:34
the shares of their company and then he started living with christ alice and harry
8:40
left their home ashamed

13:28
never become greedy greed is bad there was a man named
13:33
john who lived in bridgetown village he owned a butcher shop in the same village
13:38
john lived with his mother he has reared a lot of goats his mother took care of
13:45
these goats john's business was going well but this also made him greedy
13:52
he didn't treat his customers fairly one day an old man came to his shop hello john
13:59
i want one kilogram mutton my son oh yes uncle this is your shop too you
14:05

15:24
while talking to the boy jon removed some mutton from the plate
15:29
the innocent boy was not paying attention to this here take this this continued for many
15:37
days now john was an expert in cheating but people were unaware of this
15:43
and hence his business was growing fast one day a servant of a very rich man
15:48
edward came to his shop to order mutton hello john my boss is planning a very
15:55
big party and for that we need 40 kilometer can you give us that much button
16:01

17:02
then wait the mutton and after weighing it he removed five kilo mutton from 40 kilo mutton
17:07
now he packed only 35 kilo mutton i have folded so many people to the date
17:13
but no one has ever found out i should try cheating with a larger amount this time
17:18
now john took the packed mutton and reached the address that the servant had given to him hi it's great that you brought it so
17:25
early yes i brought it early as you have told me to be on time thanks you wait here i will get the
17:32
remaining money from my boss all right while jon was waiting the servant

17:45
the house as the night falls the party at the boss's house began there were many guests attending the
17:51
function but at dinner time to this day there was never a shortage in any of our programs
17:57
then how did mutton moss finish so soon this time last time so much was left and this time it was not enough
18:03
how is it possible yes boss that is true we have to find out how did this happen
18:09

18:14
call that chef the servant went and brought the chef with him
18:20
sir you called me why did the mutton finish so soon it has never happened then what happened
18:25
this time sir all those times the mutter was of right amount but this time it was less
18:31
so the curry was also less in quantity sundar how much mutton did you order sir i have
18:37
ordered 40 kilo as usual then why it was less call that butcher
18:43
hair he must have given us less mutton something is wrong the servant went and brought jon with
18:49
him sir you want to speak with me we ordered mutton from you but the chef is
18:56
telling me that it was less an amount we have ordered 40 kilo now tell me the truth
19:01
how much did you deliver if you lie you will regret it hearing this jon didn't speak a word and
19:07
stand ashamed he knew that his plan had failed if he lies further he will be in trouble
19:13
i am sorry sir please forgive me i won't do it again people think hundred
19:20
times before making such a mistake but you are greedy to do it i will
19:25
surely punish you edward called the police and had him arrested
19:33
from this story we learn that we should not cheat anyone because of greed because it always ends in a bad way

22:06
this one day she told james dear why do you give half of the profit to sara
22:12
we buy all the ingredients we stand in the shop all day to sell her dogs and she gets half of the profit for
22:18

23:41
pughasara and her children left his house after walking for few hours they took a break her elder son matt
23:48
said mom please don't worry we'll find a solution to this problem why don't we start our own business we
23:56
have saved some money we can use it to start our own business i think you're right
24:01
we will start our own business the next day sarah and her son started their hot dog
24:07
business and they started in the heart of the town next to the james business that day sara
24:12
made just 50 hot dogs but her business was new and hence she didn't have many customers
24:18
on the first day she became very sad son do you think we made a mistake by starting the business
24:24
mom today was the first day of this business how we will know if people liked our hot dogs or not
24:30
we will try it again tomorrow the next day sara and matt made 50 hot dogs again and started
24:36
selling them after some time a man comes to buy a hot dog how much for a hot dog only 10 rupees
24:43
the man liked the taste of the hot dog that he ate he ordered to pack 10 more hot dogs for
24:49
his family as time passed sara now had 4 customers people loved her hot dogs and james
24:56
started losing his customers one by one even everyone was talking about sarah's delicious hot dog one day
25:02
a very wealthy businessman in the town came to her shop please give me a hot dog sara gave him a
25:08
hot dog and got back to her work the businessman liked her hot dog very much sister my son is getting
25:16
married the day after tomorrow will you make tasty hot dogs for all guests i'll pay you for all of the hot
25:22
dogs i will make it and i will try to give them the best hot dog they have ever
25:27
eaten please take this as an advance businessman left after giving sarah some money in advance when
25:33
james saw this he became very jealous but he knew that he cannot say a word to her
25:39
i think we should start some other business we are not earning much profit from this hot dog's business you are right let's
25:47
start some other business in this way james and stacy had to stop
25:52
their business their greed and lives become the reason that they had suffered a loss but sarah's hot dog
25:59
business was doing great the moral of the story is that we should always fulfill our promises
26:05
and never betray anyone's trust [Music]

30:50
your bag let me see mary realizes that she has been caught
30:56
and she feels guilty mother how did you know mother-in-law starts laughing and shows
31:02
rachel the video she recorded in her mobile rachel is surprised to see mary put vegetables in her bag in the
31:08
video please forgive me i did a mistake but weren't you praying at that time i
31:15
could hear the sound of the swing that's why i could gather the courage to steal
31:21
maybe you didn't notice me holding rachel's beads not mine and if you push the swing once
31:27
it will keep swinging for at least 5 minutes it gave me enough time to record
31:33
