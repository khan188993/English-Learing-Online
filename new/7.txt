in a small village called rockland there lived a poor farmer his name was sam he lived with his wife

rebecca and a son johnny and a daughter eva sam worked hard to earn his livelihood
0:14
one day sam was working when he felt dizzy he lost his consciousness and was hurt badly he was the only bread
0:22
winner of the family so it was very difficult for them to meet their ends one day rebecca said dear i was thinking
0:31
about doing some work so that we could earn some money i can't stay at home in this situation
0:37
we barely have any food left in our home i have to do something rebecca this is
0:42
happening because of me isn't it if i was not hurt you wouldn't have to work and kids wouldn't have to
0:48
suffer what nonsense you are talking about you have done nothing wrong you will get well soon even the doctors
0:56
have no idea about when i will get well rebecca i am very worried about the future i am sure
1:02
you will get well soon i am sure of it and about earning the money i will work as a maid for some families
1:09
and earn some money you just concentrate on getting well now i will go and see if someone is hiring
1:16
then rebecca left the home and went to one family for finding work she rang the bell on
1:22
the door and a lady opened the door she asked who are you what do you want ma'am my
1:30
name is rebecca and i live across the corner i am in need of a job and i wondered if you have any work for me
1:37

1:44
household chores ma'am i will do anything you want me to do i only need a maid to do cleaning and
1:51
washing will you do it i will pay 1000 for a month i won't give you more that's ok i will
1:57

2:04
work she also found some more houses to work in she worked hard all day and would earn 5
2:11
000 per month rebecca was very happy that she was earning now but it still wasn't enough for her
2:17
family so she would bring home the food that was left behind and gave it to her family
2:23
in this way they were living their life the food that was useless for those families
2:28
was precious to rebecca's family she would filter and give the edible food to her children
2:34
one month had passed this way rebecca was now doing well all of those families were satisfied
2:40
with her work one day her mistress emily said to her rebecca a lot of yesterday's food has been left
2:47
will you take it with you yes ma'am i will definitely take it then rebecca put all the food in a
2:53
container and put it in her bag neatly after finishing her house chores she went home they loved the food and
3:00
ate it till their bellies were full from that day onwards it became a routine every day there was
3:06
something left and rebecca would ask her mistress and then took the food home now the
3:12
rainy season had started rebecca was still working but one day
3:17
she was late for work so all of her mistresses started shouting at her only emily did not get angry with her
3:25
emily asked rebecca aren't you feeling well if you are sick
3:30
then you can take a leave ma'am poor people have no luxury of taking leave
3:35
if we don't work for a day then we don't get food to eat saying this rebecca started doing her
3:41
work a few days later emily asked rebecca about her family but rebecca did not tell her about her
3:48
situation this surprised emily by then sam was able to sit by himself
3:54
and could work with the help of a stick but he was not fully recovered
3:59
he would take care of the children he narrated his children different stories and chatted with them on different
4:05
different topics one day when rebecca was going for her work it started raining
4:10
she did not have an umbrella but she still tried to save herself from rain and rushed for the work
4:16
by the time she reached the house she was soaked wet she noticed that her clothes were all
4:22

4:29
she went to emily's house on the way she thought how unlucky i am i wish the rain would
4:36

4:42
as it was raining heavily she took a shelter near a shop after waiting some time she reached
4:47
emily's house when emily saw rebecca she said rebecca why are you so wet
4:53

5:00
you won't catch a cold then it's nice of you to think about me i'm grateful but i can't accept this i'm really fine
5:08

7:51
working again there are many such laborers in our country who never tell us their stories
7:57
but they suffer a lot this is a reality you can't fight hunger everybody works
8:02
to satisfy their hunger we have no idea about how many families are suffering like this
8:09
so we have to help them in any way we can this story teaches us that we should not
8:16
consider any work less respectable and should donate the leftover food to someone who
8:22
needs it we should not waste food and always help people in need there lived a widow

26:40
confused mind gary smiles secret should remain
26:45
secret otherwise why would we call it so
26:58
he will never know
27:07
yes father come dear i have to tell you something very important
27:12
sure tell me father i have grown old tried to civilize him but i could not
27:19
improve him i feel that some lazy ghost has possessed him
27:26
daughter i give you the responsibility to drive away that lazy ghost this was
27:33
thomas's last wish since then mia started working on improving david at first she thought
27:40
that if she would help her husband in the fields then david might also feel like working hard
27:45
so she started going to the field with her husband early in the morning both of them would start working together
27:51
but david would soon feel lazy and he would sleep in the shadow of a tree and pour mia would work all alone then
27:59
mia started thinking no this trick is not working i will have to find another way
28:05
at the same time an announcement was made in the village government is going to distribute free seats tomorrow
28:10
morning at 9 at the government office anyone who wants can come to the office and take free seats
28:16
after listening to this mia went to her husband please go to the government office tomorrow morning
28:22
but why because the government is giving free seeds free knowing that it's free david's
28:30
eyes had a different glue which mia noticed oh yes free of cost next day david was
28:36
standing first in the queue at the government office david come home with the seeds mia
28:42
mia you brought the seats yes see and it's free mia started listening
28:49
to david very carefully and then she got an idea next day mia
28:54
came to david government has made more announcement are they giving free seeds again
29:00
no they will give bulls what bulls that is good this will decrease my
29:05
workload to almost half tell me where do i have to go but this is not that easy
29:11
right government has announced that anyone who grows one tonne of grain in the next three
29:17
months will get the bulls one ton what's the big deal our field is
29:23
so big that we can grow five tons of grain but who will do the hard work
29:28
you don't like to work right but we will get two bulls and then we don't need to work there
29:34
after since that day david started working hard in the fields every day he used to blow throughout the
29:40
day and water the fields after one month the seedling sprouted
29:46
and slowly the fields began to sway david continued his hard work after three months david started
29:52
harvesting them after a few days his field had big stalks of grain
29:58
look mia this must be more than one ton right yes much more now tell me where do i
30:05
have to go nowhere the buyers will come here themselves
30:10
next day a merchant came and gave one lakh rupees in cash to mia mia was very happy seeing
30:16
the money she went to the market straight away and bought two bulls and came home with the bulls listen dear
30:24
wow such strong bulls and that too free not for free you have earned them what
30:32
yes i lied to you but because of that you worked so hard and grew three tons
30:38
of grains i got one lakh rupees for three tons of grain and out of that only i bought two
30:44
bullocks for ten thousand one lakh rupees yes and here is remaining ninety thousand
30:50
david couldn't believe his eyes he had never seen so much money before from the next day david started farming
30:58
with his bulls he had turned from a lazy person to a hard-working person because he had understood that by working hard
31:04
he can achieve whatever he wants did you see father i fulfilled your last wish by kicking
31:12
out the lazy ghost
