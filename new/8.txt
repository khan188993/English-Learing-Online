13:37
the palace
13:38
princess susie dressed like her maid so
13:41

13:44
after some time stephen and susie go to
13:46
the prince's room
13:47
hiding from everyone the prince was
13:50
looking out from his window
13:52
that's when susie calls out the prince
13:54
your highness
13:55
i'm back hearing her voice the prince
13:58
looks at her but he couldn't believe
14:01
what he was
14:02
seeing he sees the princess dressed like
14:04
a normal maid
14:05
he asks what are you doing in these
14:08
clothes
14:09
your highness you did recognize me my
14:12
stepmother came to this palace and after
14:14
doing some magic tricks on me she sent
14:16

14:26
after getting the princess order all the
14:29
royal guards gather in the court
14:31
that's when the prince along with
14:33
princess comes to the palace
14:35
reaching into the palace he orders the
14:37
royal guards to call the fake princess
14:39
and her maid
14:41
after some time the fake princess and
14:43
her mother comes to the court and
14:45
notices princess suzie
14:47
standing besides the prince they become
14:50
furious and they turn into their real
14:53
self
14:54
put them into the dungeon right now they
14:58
tried to kill the princess
15:00
you think you can put me in dungeon no
15:03
one can ever catch me
15:04
and i will take revenge from this
15:06
princess saying this
15:08
shelley tries her spells of magic tricks
15:11
on princess
15:12
susie that's when suzy splashes the
15:14
miraculous water
15:15
given by the saint on shelley and with
15:17
the help of the miraculous water
15:19
shelley's magic trick stops working
15:22
seeing all this
15:23
shelley becomes very furious and
15:25
couldn't control herself
15:26
she was not understanding what to do now
15:29
that's when the royal guards put
15:31
shelley and stella into the dungeon
15:34
seeing this the prince and the princess
15:35
become very happy
15:37
and with the help of the miraculous
15:38
water shelley's magical powers get
15:41
destroyed
15:41
and along with that stiffen also becomes
15:44
human once again
15:45
after all this happened everybody
15:47
becomes very happy
15:49
and they all live very happily so this
15:52
story teaches us that we should always
15:54
do good deeds in our life
15:56
and we should not do anything wrong to
15:58
anyone
