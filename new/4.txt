[Music] in the small town of rockville there lived a woman marry she had a daughter tracy and a son owen

her son worked as a manager in a very big bank and mary was very proud about it she took very good care of her son
0:15
owen was very obedient and would always listen to his mother mary's daughter tracy wanted to go study
0:21
further and to work like her brother but mary believed that woman shouldn't be working in office so as soon as tracy
0:29
finished her studies mary found a nice groom and got her daughter married in grand event
0:35
then she started looking for a bride for her son one day mary's brother sam and
0:41
his wife lisa came to their house welcome brother what is the reason behind this surprise visit
0:48
i was in the neighborhood regarding my daughter's marriage so i thought i should see how you are doing so nice of
0:54
you brother otherwise you don't have time for anything else than your work so what you say it's a nice family so i am
1:01
thinking that i should get the elder daughter married as soon as possible then there are three more kids whose marriages i have to arrange for you have
1:08
taken a right decision brother you should get alice married very soon she's completing her studies this year right
1:15
yes that's why i started searching for the groom mary if you don't mind
1:20
shall i ask you something come on lisa why would i mind you can't say anything don't hesitate
1:28
you know our alice very well you know that she's quite well mannered
1:33
she always stops in her class and she also knows how to do all the house chores she respects elders too of course
1:41
lisa i know that alice is very nice girl i have seen her since childhood
1:46
she is my favorite niece but please be clear about what are you trying to say
1:52
um mary i was thinking that instead of searching a groom from unknown family it
1:57
will be better if you accept alice as your daughter-in-law i heard you are also searching for a bride for sam if it
2:03
happens there will be no problem at all mary thought to herself alice is really nice girl she is well
2:11
cultured and beautiful too but lisa had all four girls what if alice marries my son and gives
2:18
birth to only daughters no way my daughter-in-law should give birth to a son who will continue this
2:24
family line i can't accept this proposal after knowing all this i should refuse now so i won't regret it
2:31
further this is very nice idea lisa but the problem is my husband don't like
2:38
marriages arranged between the relatives but you don't worry
2:43
i will help you find a nice boy for alice lisa knew very well that mary is
2:48

9:28
mother's nature don't worry tracy i'm just doing my duty as a woman i can't
9:34
leave other women to herself in this situation we have to understand this
9:39
first of all we should do our duty as a woman i know what you need in this situation
9:45
and hence i am giving it all to you as there was no one for me who took care of me what happened in my case i won't let
9:53
that happen to you now it was time for tracy's delivery and she gave birth to a beautiful daughter
10:00
but her mother-in-law didn't like that and she started insulting tracy in front of marry
10:06

10:12
we all know how much your mother tortured your sister-in-law i am just telling you what i want keep
10:19
that in mind saying this her mother-in-law left mary was listening to all this conversation now she was
10:26
regretting about her behavior now she understood that she was a woman yet she failed to understood what her
10:32
daughter-in-law is going through and when this happened to her own daughter she realized her mistake
10:39
she couldn't look into diana's eyes due to shame now her thinking changed
10:44
she apologized to her daughter-in-law and since that day she started treating boy and girl equally she even gave
10:51
permission to diana to search a job she started taking responsibilities at home
10:56
