his home seeing the inspector richard
15:03
asked him
15:05
what happened inspector what are you
15:07

us what happened to you i did the right
15:23
thing
15:24
inspector take them with you or make
15:27
them understand
15:28
they just don't know how to talk with
15:30
people
15:31
looking her behavior richard and his
15:33
mother was very upset the inspector said
15:36
awful lot of things to richard and left
15:39
then richard and his mother goes back to
15:41
their respective rooms and none of them
15:43
talked to each other then suddenly roma
15:46
says
15:47
well done
15:48
whatever happened was absolutely right
15:51
and to people like them that's what
15:53
should happen
15:54
saying this the next day roma goes to
15:56
her parents house roma's mother-in-law
15:59
had already told her mother about this
16:01
incidence on phone so when roma arrived
16:04
her mother said
16:06
roma
16:07
do you even understand what you have
16:09
done you just ruined your marriage with
16:11
this one incident they used to talk to
16:14
me in a very rude manner that's why i
16:16
did this now i don't want to go back
16:18
there there's no place for you in my
16:21
home if someday i will say something to
16:23
you then you will put us into the jail
16:26
too that's why you can't stay in my
16:28
house then where will i go mom go
16:30
wherever you want whatever you have done
16:33
was a very bad thing to do
16:35
now apologize for that and return back
16:38
to your own home got it
16:41
saying this ruby left
16:43
and roma realized her mistake
16:45
and she started thinking i have really
16:48
behaved wrongly with my own people
16:51
i need to apologize to them
16:53
let's see if they forgive me or not
16:56
thinking this roma returns back to her
16:59
in-laws and her mother-in-law said
17:02
why did you come back roma please mom
17:04
forgive me for my mistakes i did wrong
17:08
how could you ask for forgiveness roma
17:11
if my son forgives you
17:13
then only i will forgive you
17:15
yes mom i will ask for his forgiveness
17:18
too
17:21
now what else do you want roma please
17:24
forgive me
17:25
i have done a huge mistake
17:27
i will never do that again
17:30
roma started crying
17:33
and forgiving her
17:35
richard hugged roma
17:37
and since then she had changed her
17:39
behavior
17:41
now she do all the household chores and
17:43
respect elders
17:45
from shameless daughter-in-law roma had
17:48
transformed into a cultured
17:50
daughter-in-law
17:52
so from this story we learned that we
17:55
should always respect others and we
17:58
shouldn't humiliate anyone we should
18:00
always maintain good behavior with
18:03
everyone

people kept the donkey in a tent my lord
22:29
kindly send the soldiers and maids one
22:31
by one into the tent and all of them
22:33
have to hold the donkey's tail and say i
22:36

22:38
donkey's tail then my friend will tell
22:40
who the thief is okay so soldiers and
22:43
maids you all go there one by one and
22:45
hold the donkey's tail
22:47
and then all the soldiers and maid went
22:49
to hold the donkey's tail now i will go
22:52
and ask my friend who is the thief after
22:55
something my lord i will have to smell
22:57
each one's hand and then after smelling
22:59
the hat this soldier is the thief no my
23:02
lord i have not stolen anything i have
23:04
served you for so many years the
23:06
donkey's testimony doesn't prove
23:08
anything
23:09
how can you say that he's the thief how
23:11
can you understand a donkey's language
23:14
my lord i had put a special scent on the
23:16
donkey's tail that is why i asked
23:18
everyone to hold the donkey's tail i
23:21
knew the thief will not hold it in fear
23:23
of getting caught the scent came
23:25
apparently from everyone's hand but when
23:27
i smelled his hands there was no scent
23:30
therefore he is the thief
23:33
ungrateful man i will punish you my lord
23:37
please forgive me i had become greedy
23:39
please forgive me i will return all the
23:42
stolen things you please forgive me my
23:45
lord
23:46
no you will not be forgiven biting the
23:48
hands that feed you
23:50
soldiers take him and put him in jail
23:53
people once again you caught the thief
23:55
with your cleverness thank you people
