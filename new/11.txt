angel and emily remembered the last
6:30
evening's incident
6:40
oh it was you but we still didn't get
6:43
why
6:43
you are rejecting angel because
6:46
yesterday's incident showed me
6:48
that your daughter only looks beautiful
6:50
but she don't have beautiful nature
6:52
and to have a happy life kind nature is
6:54
more important than the beautiful face

to marry her
7:01
after hearing his words angel regretted
7:04
her
7:04

7:31
care of her
7:32
my father is no more and hence i'm her
7:35
only support
7:36
everyone gets emotional after hearing
7:39

7:41

7:42

7:45
and come back to india will you be upset
7:48
his words

lazy donkey
11:37
once upon a time in a small town there
11:40
lived a hard-working merchant
11:42
the merchant had many animals all the
11:45
animals were loyal and efficient to him
11:47
however he also had a donkey who was
11:50
very lazy
11:51
and only preferred sleeping and eating
11:54
come on
11:54
let us see the story of this lazy donkey
12:02
i don't see the donkey anywhere is he
12:05
still
12:06
sleeping he has to carry salt sacks
12:08
today master
12:10
i will go and look for him
12:14
[Music]
12:19
hey lazy jack get up soon you have to
12:22
carry salt bags today
12:25
leave me alone i want to sleep for some
12:28
more time
12:29
[Music]
12:31
let me teach this lazy donkey a lesson
12:40
this monkey tries to please the master
12:43
all the time
12:46
the monkey should be made to carry all
12:47
the load and only then will he know how
12:50
difficult it is
12:53
[Music]
12:55
[Laughter]
12:59
we will be selling salt for a few days
13:01
hmm
13:02
yes master time to work jack
13:08
why are you two fooling around when
13:09
there is so much work to do
13:12
stop it the merchant and the donkey left
13:14
for their work
13:15
however the lazy donkey was not at all
13:18
happy with the task that was given
13:20
to him hurry up master
13:24
i am tired tired so soon
13:28
stop being lazy and hurry up donkey's
13:30
tactics did not work
13:32
in front of his master for he knew that
13:34
the donkey was lazy
13:40
oh gosh the heat is unbearable
13:44
the cool river water seems to be calling
13:47
me
13:54
hey what are you doing hmm
13:58
interesting the load seems to have
14:01
reduced
14:03
you foolish donkey do you even know what
14:05
you have
14:06
done all the salt must have dissolved in
14:08
the water
14:09
oh please pardon me master
14:14
i slipped accidentally all right
14:18
but i hope you didn't hurt yourself no
14:20
master
14:22
the merchant's salt sacks were destroyed
14:25
so the merchant and the donkey left for
14:27
their house
14:29
hmm why didn't i think of this brilliant
14:32
idea before
14:35
the donkey realized that the load was
14:37
getting lighter
14:38
when he fell in the water so he
14:40
purposely started slipping into the
14:42
river every day
14:43
so that the socks became lighter
14:47
there's been so much loss since the last
14:49
few days
14:50
hey donkey you better be careful today
14:53
don't ruin masters salt bags
15:01
the donkey didn't care about the great
15:03
loss he was causing to his master
15:05
as usual he went near the river and
15:07
purposely slipped
15:09
oh no not again forgive me master
15:13
but it's too slippery out here
15:17
[Music]
15:18
what happened master huh
15:21
the donkey is fooling me
15:26
why do you think so
15:29
something is fishy every day the donkey
15:32
slips in the water exactly at the same
15:34
place and ruins my salt bags
15:37
in order to teach the donkey a lesson
15:40
the monkey and merchant decide to put
15:42
cotton instead of salt in the sacks
15:46
now let's see what will happen
15:50
this will surely teach the donkey a
15:52
lesson
15:56
[Music]
16:00
the load feels so light today
16:04
a dip in the water and the weight will
16:06
totally disappear
16:11
what is so funny right now
16:13
[Music]
16:14
um nothing master
16:18
stop laughing and do some work
16:23
[Music]
16:32
good heavens why isn't the load
16:36
decreasing
16:38
to the horror of the donkey the load on
16:41
his back had become
16:42
ten times heavier as the cotton had
16:45
absorbed
16:46
all the water you were fooling me all
16:50
along weren't you because of your
16:53
laziness
16:54
i have lost so much money i hope this
16:57
turns out to be a good lesson for you
17:04
am so sorry master
17:07
[Music]
17:12
the donkey learned his lesson and from
17:14
that day onwards
17:16
the donkey never fell in the water
17:18
purposely
17:21
be it rain or shine the donkey carried
17:23
the load happily
17:25
[Music]
17:26
the moral of the story is avoiding work
17:30
leads to more work
17:31
[Music]
17:44
ugly duckling
17:47
once upon a time in an old farm there
17:50
lived a lovely duck
17:54
the duck had laid a clutch of new eggs
17:57
and was now sitting on them happily
17:59
expecting to build her new family
18:01
[Music]
18:03
the long wait was now over after some
18:07
time
18:09
the x-craft and out popped six chirpy
18:12
ducklings with bright
18:14
eyes and pretty little beaks mother duck
18:16
was
18:17
very happy one egg was left to hatch
18:20
this egg was much bigger compared to the
18:22
other eggs
18:23
[Music]
18:25
this egg is quite big maybe that's why
18:28
it's taking so much time
18:30
but that's all right i will wait for my
18:32
baby
18:33
i'm sure the little duckling will be
18:35
worth all the weight
18:36
finally the egg started to crack and out
18:39
came the last duckling
18:40
but mother duck's happiness soon turned
18:43
into confusion
18:44
for the seventh duckling was quite
18:46
different from the rest
18:47
and wasn't pretty mother duck was upset
18:51
but her motherly instincts made her
18:52
embrace the ugly duckling into the brood
18:54
as well
18:55
but the rest of the flock was not kind
18:57
towards the ugly duckling
18:59
you look strange and ugly stay away from
19:02
us
19:02
on hearing such harsh words ugly
19:05
duckling was heartbroken and upset my
19:10
siblings won't play with me am i
19:13
so ugly time passed and the ducklings
19:16
were growing up
19:17
the ducklings still wouldn't play with
19:19
the ugly duckling and remained
19:20
indifferent towards him
19:22
haven't we warned you enough already
19:24
that we don't want to play with you
19:26
stay away from us ugly duckling
19:30
don't be so mean to your own sibling
19:33
mom when will my siblings start liking
19:37
me
19:38
don't be upset for a day will come when
19:41
you will know your worth
19:43
all of a sudden a hunter entered the
19:45
pond and started attacking the ducks
19:48
the cruel hunter captured the mother
19:50
duck wait wait
19:51
mom mom mommy was the only one who cared
19:55
for me
19:56
now there's no point staying here i must
19:59
leave
20:01
ugly duckling left to the place with a
20:03
heavy heart but he still hoped to find a
20:05
nicer family to call his own
20:07
on his way the duckling saw beautiful
20:10
birds
20:10
but even those birds drove him away i'm
20:13
so ugly that no one wants to play with
20:15
me or even
20:16
talk to me i guess i'm destined to be
20:20
alone
20:21
poor duckling stayed isolated in a cave
20:24
it
20:24
seemed as if the weather had also turned
20:27
against him
20:28
with the biting frost and cold ugly
20:30
duckling had decided to finally step out
20:33
of the cave the ugly duckling was in
20:35
reality
20:36
a beautiful swan but he had no idea
20:39
as he stepped out into the pond he saw a
20:42
flock of swans floating majestically in
20:44
the water
20:45
wow these swans are so beautiful
20:49
hey buddy isn't the weather lovely come
20:51
over
20:52
and join us for a swim ugly duckling was
20:55
surprised by the friendly invitation
20:57
ugly duckling excitedly waddled his way
21:00
into the water
21:00
and was taken aback by his reflection in
21:03
the water
21:04
whoa i can't believe this is that really
21:07
me
21:08
i'm a beautiful swan
21:11
ugly duckling's happiness knew no bounds
21:13
as he had finally found acceptance in
21:15
his life as a swan
21:23
wow what beautiful birds
21:27
ugly duckling was now one of the
21:29
beautiful swans
21:33
the moral of the story is we shouldn't
21:35
discriminate people
21:37
based on their physical appearance
21:48
the wolf and the seven little ghosts
21:51
once upon a time in a dense forest seven

21:56
mother
21:57
the mother goat loved her kids
21:58
unconditionally and took great care of
22:01
them
22:02
every day the mother goat would go out
22:04
into the forest to collect some food for
22:06
her little ones
22:07
the little goats would stay alone and
22:09
played with each other till their mother
22:10
came home
22:14
one day a sneaky wolf got to know that
22:17
seven little goats were all alone in
22:18
their home
22:21
seven delicious little goats it would be
22:24
so much fun to feast on them

23:15
hmm no sooner had the wolf hit the
23:19
honeycomb with a stone
23:21
all the bees attacked him
23:25
the foolish wolf thought that the honey
23:27
would immediately turn his voice
23:29
sweet
23:31
[Music]
23:33
the wolf came back knocking at the door
23:36

24:03
[Music]
24:07
the world broke open the door and
24:08
growled as he showed his teeth
24:11
the little goats were shocked and
24:13
started running helter skelter
24:15
they hid themselves wherever they
24:17
possibly could
24:18
the tiniest goat hid herself in a tall
24:21
clock case
24:22
[Music]
24:24
so little kids where are you all hiding
24:28

24:36
i have gobbled you up
24:38
wolf found the little goats from their
24:40
hidings one by one
24:41
and then dumped them in a sack and took
24:43
them away the tiniest goat
24:46
hiding in the clock case was the only
24:48
one he did not find
24:50
the mother goat was shocked to see the
24:51
door open when she returned back
24:54
oh what a sight she saw there everything
24:56
was a mess and there were
24:57
large footprints of the wolf on the
24:59
floor mother goat started weeping
25:02
bitterly for her dear children
25:04
oh mommy dear the big bad wolf came
25:08
and took all my siblings away
25:11
mother goat and the little goat went
25:13
looking for the big bad wolf
25:15
do you know where the big bad wolf
25:17
resides
25:20
the mother goat silently peeped into the
25:22
wolf's house
25:24
the little goat recognized the sack and
25:26
told her mother
25:28
mommy the wolf had put everyone in this
25:31
sack
25:31
[Music]
25:33
i need more wood to cook a sumptuous
25:35
meal
25:36
the very instant the wolf headed outside
25:38
the mother goat and little goat
25:40
hurriedly entered the house and opened
25:42
the sack before the wolf could come back
25:45
they put stones inside the sack and
25:47
quickly hid themselves
25:49
excited to cook his grand meal the wolf
25:51
checked the sack from far
25:53
and happily began the preparations now
25:56
let's
25:56
teach that wove a good lesson
26:00
[Music]
26:04
oh now i can't be sharing my food with
26:07
the lion
26:08
the wolf quickly lifted the sack and
26:10
rushed toward the forest
26:13
goat's children kept roaring to scare
26:15
the wolf
26:17
why does this feel so heavy
26:20
the wolf began to run really fast the
26:23
wolf was exhausted and accidentally fell
26:25
into the river
26:26
a hungry crocodile in the river soon
26:29
feasted on the wolf
26:30
the big bad wolf was no more
26:35
so friends the moral of the story is do
26:38
not let others exploit your
26:50
gentleness
27:16
you
