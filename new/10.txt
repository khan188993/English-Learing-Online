20:37
fragrant flower what are you saying oh i
20:40

20:40
everything you can transform yourself
20:42

20:44
the prince and emma then go to the
20:46
garden the princess showers a bowl of
20:48
rose petals on her
20:50
emma turns into a beautiful flowering
20:52
tree
20:53
the prince is very pleased to see this
20:55
the whole palace is filled with the
20:57
sweet fragrance of the flowers
20:59
princess mia used to watch this from the
21:01
window every day heart of heart she felt
21:03
very jealous
21:04
one fine day she took the permission of
21:06
the king and the queen to take
21:08
emma out to play with her mia you are
21:11
taking her with you
21:12
she is your responsibility do you get it
21:15
yes father mia takes emma along with her
21:18
to play with her friends
21:20
mia wants to show her friends how emma
21:23
could transform herself into a tree
21:25
she tells emma emma come on show my
21:28
friends
21:29
how you can turn yourself into a
21:31
flowering tree what nonsense are you
21:33
talking about mia
21:34
am i a magician or what i know
21:36
everything do it
21:37
right now i shouldn't have come out with
21:40
you it's a great mistake
21:42
emma then explains all the rules to mia
21:44
and her friends
21:45
she wants them not to pluck leaves and
21:47
break the branches
21:49
all the friends bring the required
21:51
things and making emma
21:52
sit on the ground they pour the rose
21:54
petals on her in a very clumsy manner
21:57
emma turns into a flowering tree all the
22:00
friends are thrilled
22:01
and they start plucking the flowers
22:04
suddenly it starts raining heavily
22:06
and the friends break the branches on
22:08
the tree
22:09
one of the friends currently pours a pot
22:11
of water over the tree
22:13
mia and all her friends run away from
22:15
there emma
22:16
is left all alone bruised and crippled
22:19
finally she takes the help of a traveler
22:22
the traveller is kind enough
22:24
to drop emma at her house her mother is
22:27
very upset to see her in this condition
22:29
she starts her treatment and there in
22:31
the palace
22:33
mia where is emma she didn't come back
22:36
where have you left her she will come
22:38
back by herself
22:40
the queen is trying to ask princess mia
22:42
about emma
22:44
but she's not telling anything when
22:46
shawn is trying hard to find emma
22:48
everywhere but she's found nowhere
22:50
one day the prince is crossing emma's
22:52
house
22:54
and there he suddenly finds her he
22:56
reaches out to her
22:58
princess you are here and i've been
23:00
searching for you everywhere but i
23:02
couldn't find you
23:04
why are you here i'm not going to send
23:06
my daughter with you
23:08
shell then tells the whole story to the
23:09
prince
23:11
mia will have to pay for her actions i
23:13
will see that she is appropriately
23:15
punished
23:16
i will return to the palace only if you
23:19
promise me to forgive me
23:21
as your wish princess the prince agrees
23:24
to it
23:24
and takes her back to the palace mia
23:27
begs for forgiveness
23:28
emma had already forgiven her the king
23:31
calls for the coronation of gwyn sean
23:33
and princess emma
23:35
they become the king and queen of the
23:36
kingdom king shawn takes good care of
23:39
his queen
23:40
they both live a very happy life
23:41
thereafter the moral of the story
23:44
is that we should always be ready to
23:46
help one another but if anyone tries to
23:48
play with our modesty then we should
23:50
also be taught a good lesson because
23:51
enduring injustice is
23:53
as bad as the crime itself
