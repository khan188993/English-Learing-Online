looking at his wife going inside with a
17:34
confused mind
17:36
gary smiles secret should remain
17:40
secret otherwise why would we call it so
17:52
he will never know
18:01
yes father come dear i have to tell you
18:04
something very
18:05
important sure tell me father i have
18:09
grown old tried to civilize him
18:12
but i could not improve him
18:15
i feel that some lazy ghost has
18:18
possessed him daughter i give you the
18:22
responsibility to drive away
18:24
that lazy ghost this was thomas's last
18:28
wish
18:30
since then mia started working on
18:32
improving david
18:33
at first she thought that if she would
18:35
help her husband in the fields
18:37
then david might also feel like working
18:39
hard so she started going to the field
18:41
with her husband
18:42
early in the morning both of them would
18:44
start working together but david would
18:46
soon feel lazy
18:47
and he would sleep in the shadow of a
18:49
tree and poor mia would work
18:52
all alone then mia started thinking
18:55
no this trick is not working i will have
18:58
to find
18:58
another way at the same time an
19:00
announcement was made in the village
19:02
government is going to distribute free
19:04
seats tomorrow morning at 9 at the
19:06
government office
19:07
anyone who wants can come to the office
19:09
and take free seats
19:10
after listening to this mia went to her
19:12
husband please go to the government
19:14
office tomorrow morning
19:16
but why because the government is giving
19:19
free seeds
19:20
free knowing that it's free david's eyes
19:24
had a different glue
19:26
which mia noticed oh yes free of cost
19:30
next day david was standing first in the
19:32
queue at the government office
19:34
david come home with the seeds mia mia
19:38
you brought the seeds yes see
19:41
and it's free mia started listening to
19:44
david very carefully
19:45
and then she got an idea next day mia
19:49
came to david
19:50
government has made more announcement
19:52
are they giving free seeds again
19:54
no they will give bulls what bulls

20:25
get two bulls
20:27

20:29
after since that day
20:30
david started working hard in the fields
20:33
every day he used to blow throughout the
20:35
day and water the fields
20:38
after one month the seedling sprouted
20:41
and slowly the fields began to sway
20:43
david continued his hard work
20:45
after three months david started
20:47
harvesting them
20:48
after a few days his field had big
20:50
stalks of grain
20:53

21:07

21:45
david couldn't believe his eyes he had
21:48
never seen so much money before
21:50
from the next day david started farming
21:52
with his balls he had turned from a lazy
21:54
person to a hard-working person
21:56
because he had understood that by
21:58
working hard he can achieve
22:00
