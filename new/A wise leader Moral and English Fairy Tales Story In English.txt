0:00
there lived a man named austin in a
0:03
village. he was a leader of a village.
0:05
people in that village respected him
0:08
very much as he was the leader of the
0:10
village. people would come to him if they
0:12
had wanted to solve any disagreement. he
0:15
would also give a correct solution for
0:17
their argument and make them content.
0:20
he had two sons the elder was christ and
0:23
the younger one was kevin.
0:26
austie used to teach them that
0:28
one can achieve success with the help of
0:30
honesty hard work and wisdom.
0:34
kevin used to spend most of his time
0:37
working along with his father hence even
0:39
though he was younger than christ. he was
0:42
much more experienced and wise compared
0:44
to christ. whereas christ believed that
0:48
you live life once,
0:50
so you have to enjoy your life to the
0:52
fullest. as per him
0:54
struggle hard work
0:56
and honesty were good only in books.
0:59
he never tried to achieve these
1:01
qualities.
1:02
everything was fine in their family
1:05
but one night while having dinner austin
1:08
had a heartbeat. his family members
1:11
rushed him to the hospital but they
1:13
could not save his life.
1:15
his death shook not only his family
1:17
but all the villagers also.
1:20
he had helped lots of people in the
1:22
village.
1:23
after his death people felt as if they
1:26
had lost their own family member.
1:29
one month passed, now everyone was
1:32
worried about who will solve the
1:34
disagreement between the people.
1:36
who is as hard working
1:38
skilled wise and fair as austin. the
1:42
village had a rule that if a leader of
1:44
the village dies and if there is an
1:47
experienced befitting person with good
1:49
leadership skill in his family then he
1:52
will be selected as the new leader of
1:54
the village.
1:55
and if there is no such person in that
1:57
leader's family
1:58
then all villagers would select a new
2:00
leader with all these qualities.
2:03
all the elder people held a meeting to
2:05
decide
2:06
who should be their next leader.
2:08
after selecting the new leader, they
2:10
informed everyone in the village to
2:12
gather at the specific place next week
2:15
to know the result of this election.
2:18
all the people in the village were eager
2:20
to know
2:21
the name of their next leader. the day of
2:23
the announcement came, austin's both sons
2:26
were also present at that place.
2:29
the alderson christ was very confident
2:32
that he will be selected as the new
2:34
leader as he was the elder son.
2:36
all the villagers and the younger son
2:38
trusted elder to make the right decision.
2:41
they knew that
2:43
whatever decision these elders would
2:45
take
2:46
will be beneficial for everyone.
2:49
one of the elders stood up
2:51
and announced their decision.
2:53
after discussing everyone has
2:55
anonymously reached the decision that,
2:57
kevin will be our next leader
2:59
as he is very trustworthy hardworking
3:01
and wise.
3:02
hearing this news everyone in the
3:04
village accepted this decision happily
3:07
except christ. he was very sad and
3:10
thought that even though he was the
3:12
eldest son, he was not selected.
3:15
everyone returned their home. like this
3:18
few months passed,
3:20
one day two women of that village had a
3:23
disagreement. the members of their family
3:26
went to kevin's home to solve their
3:28
issue. kevin listened to both parties
3:30
argument but when it was time to give
3:32
the decision,
3:33
before they finished talking
3:35
christ started talking so the people who
3:38
had come there to solve the issue told
3:40
him that he is not the leader of the
3:42
villager. kevin is the leader
3:44
this made christ very angry but he kept
3:47
quiet in front of everyone .after few
3:50
days christ was going somewhere,
3:53
when he saw a lady
3:54
who had lost the argument the other day
3:57
she was not happy with the decision.
3:59
kevin gave and despised him very much.
4:02
she was a very wicked woman.
4:04
when she saw christ she thought,
4:07
now is the right time to take revenge.
4:10
she made up her mind and went to christ
4:12
and started praising him. christ, you are
4:16
a very kind and naive man but your
4:18
brother has become very arrogant since
4:21
he became a leader of the village. he is
4:23
younger than you but he is ruling over
4:26
this village. everyone follows his
4:28
decision. because of him people
4:30
underestimate me, i don't know what is
4:33
wrong with them. they don't give a chance
4:36
to austin's elder son to prove himself. i
4:39
feel very bad for you. i don't know how
4:42
do you live with him under one room. her
4:45
words made christ very angry
4:47
and he returned home.
4:50
he couldn't stop thinking about the old
4:52
lady's world. he used to agree happily
4:55
with kevin's all decision regarding
4:57
their family. but now he started
5:00
insulting kevin at every step. everyone
5:03
in the family was disappointed to see
5:05
the change in christ's behavior. but no
5:07
one dared to say a word in front of him.
5:10
he would fight every day. one day their
5:12
mother decided to solve the issue and
5:14
ask them to sit and then she tried to
5:16
make christ understand ,but this made
5:18
christ even more angry and he decided to
5:21
leave the house and work in some other
5:23
village. everyone tried to stop him but
5:25
he didn't listen to anyone he went to
5:27
one village and reached a rich man's
5:29
house. he asked for a job from this rich
5:31
man, who was very cunning clever and
5:34
tight-fisted. when christ requested him
5:36
for a job,
5:37
he said
5:38
i can give you a job but i have two
5:40
simple rules, which you have to follow
5:43
first. one is if i tell you to do
5:45
something you have to do it on right
5:47
time
5:48
and my second rule is you cannot get
5:50
angry at me at all if you get angry then
5:53
i'll cut your nose and took back all the
5:55
money that i have paid to you and if you
5:58
made me happy by following these two
6:00
rules then i'll give you a reward. after
6:02
hearing these rules christ didn't waste
6:04
time thinking and happily agreed to work
6:07
for him.
6:08
like this few days passed
6:11
christ followed the rich man's rule
6:13
and work hard to earn money.
6:15
one night the rich man thought
6:18
if he keeps working like this.
6:20
he'll take all of my money
6:22
he made a plan in his mind.
6:25
next day he woke up early and called
6:27
christ and said, today you go to my
6:29
fields and clothe them and then sow them
6:31
with seeds, so christ went to his field
6:34
and when he saw that rich man had huge
6:36
field he got very angry.
6:39
but he remembered the rule about cutting
6:41
the nose somehow he managed to finish
6:43
the work. that was the first day
6:46
no one called him for a meal.
6:48
at his home everyone used to take care
6:51
of him especially kevin, who would never
6:53
eat his meal before christ but now
6:56
was not the time to regret. he went to
7:00
sleep without having dinner. next day in
7:02
the morning the rich man came to his
7:04
room and started shouting. hey!!
7:07
why are you still in the bed?
7:09
do i pay you for taking the rest? i have
7:11
fields in next village also. you have to
7:13
sow seeds in those fields too. christ
7:15
didn't like that. rich man was shouting
7:17
at him. early in the morning he was very
7:20
angry but he also remembered his rules
7:22
so he has to keep quiet. when he started
7:25
to leave, the rich man called him hey
7:27
christ! listen bring some fish or meat
7:29
for me while returning home. hearing this
7:31
christ got very angry and said. i haven't
7:34
eaten a bite since yesterday and you
7:36
want to eat meat.
7:38
rich man was waiting for this moment so
7:40
long. he cuts christ's nose and took away
7:43
all the money that christ had earned.
7:45
christ became very sad and returned to
7:48
his home empty-handed .after going home
7:50
he told his brother everything. kevin had
7:53
an idea and then he went to that rich
7:56
man's house and told him.
7:58
sir i heard that you need a servant i am
8:01
looking for a job,
8:02
will you hire me?
8:04
once again the rich man told him about
8:06
his two rules kevin said to him. i agree
8:09
with all of your rules but i also have a
8:11
rule, that if you got angry then i'll cut
8:15
your nose.
8:16
proud rich man
8:18
agreed to his rule,
8:20
kevin started working for him he would
8:22
do his job happily.
8:24
one day the rich man decided to bother
8:27
him as he had done with christ. he woke
8:29
kevin up early in the morning and sent
8:32
him to work in the fields and asked him
8:34
to bring meat while returning.
8:37
kevin agreed to it,
8:38
he took the rich man's dog
8:40
bruno
8:42
along with him.
8:43
kevin did not finish his work and in the
8:45
afternoon he went home and started
8:48
resting, when the rich man saw him he
8:50
wondered,
8:51
how could kevin finish so much work so
8:53
soon? so he went to his field to see how
8:56
much work is done. when he saw that work
8:59
is not finished. he became very angry but
9:02
he remembered kevin's rule. at night when
9:04
the richmond sat for his dinner he asked,
9:07
have you brought the meat? kevin happily
9:10
replied yes and served him the meat.
9:12
after finishing the dinner the man took
9:14
a piece of meat in his hand and started
9:17
calling his dog bruro. bruno come on
9:21
bruno! kevin smiled and replied
9:24
bruno is not here.
9:26
why where is my bruno?
9:28
he is in your stomach.
9:30
have you gone mad? you killed my favorite
9:32
dog and fed him to me? hey
9:35
are you angry with me?
9:37
of course yes.
9:39
i am very angry with you. can't you see
9:41
that? you have made me angry, when he said
9:43
this. kevin cut his nose and took the
9:46
money that he had earned then he
9:48
returned home. he told christ about how
9:52
he taught the rich man a lesson.
9:54
now christ
9:55
also understood that
9:57
being older is not enough. smartness is
10:00
also very important.
10:02
this story tells us that you get
10:05
excellence due to the knowledge not due
10:07
to the age.


================================================
10:09
they left a saint in a village called
10:11
excess. he was meditating since years and
10:14
so he had achieved lot of divine powers.
10:18
he could control fire water and wind.
10:22
one day while he was meditating, he felt
10:24
dizzy because of heavy sun and he fell
10:27
unconscious.
10:28
there lived three friends in that village.
10:31
their names were charles paul and joseph.
10:34
the three of them were very good friends.
10:37
they always lived together.
10:40
one day they all were roaming in the
10:42
forest and suddenly charles saw a saint.
10:46
hey paul!
10:47
joseph!
10:48
see it, seems that saint has fainted.
10:52
come let's go and check! yeah let's go.
10:56
saying this the three of them went there.
10:59
they saw that saint was unconscious.
11:02
charles sat near him and massaged his
11:04
hands and feet.
11:06
paul brought water from the river and
11:09
joseph fanned him with a cloth.
11:12
then joseph put water in his mouth and
11:14
sprinkled some of them on his face, after
11:17
some time the saint regained his
11:20
consciousness and the saint got up and
11:22
asked them,
11:23
you have helped me so much,
11:26
who are you son?
11:28
sir we were passing by and saw that you
11:31
were unconscious so we helped you. are
11:34
you feeling better sir?
11:36
yes.
11:37

11:39

11:42
so i am very happy with you.
11:45
charles
11:46
who massage my feet.
11:49
will have fire from the sun.
11:52
and paul
11:54
who put water in my mouth
11:56
will get energy from water,
11:59
with the help of which he will create
12:02
water wherever he wants.
12:04
and the third
12:06
joseph
12:08
who fanned me with pleasant air
12:11
he will always have the energy of wind,
12:15
and he will be able to create air
12:19
as per his wish.
12:21
i am giving the three of you these three
12:24
powers.
12:26
but never use these powers in the wrong
12:29
way.
12:30
[Music]
12:31
hearing this charles paul and joseph
12:34
became very happy,
12:35
and they greeted the saint and went from
12:38
there.
12:39
while they were going they had a
12:41
question.
12:42
if these powers are really with us
12:45
we should know how to use them properly.
12:48
isn't it friends?
12:49
yes your idea is good come. let's test
12:53
them.
12:54
yes come.
12:55
now charles stole his power.
12:58
let the tree burn.
13:03
let that tree get extinguished. at that
13:06
time there is rain on the tree and all
13:08
of them keep staring at each other, and
13:11
they became very happy. let the deer fly
13:14
in air.
13:15
as soon as he said that while deer
13:18
started flying in the air seeing all
13:20
this, all the three of them became very
13:22
happy and returned home. the next day
13:25
when they were going in the village they
13:27
saw a thief running after stealing
13:29
something. then joseph used his air power
13:32
and pulled him, he hanged him over to the
13:34
police. moving forward, they saw some men
13:36
were working in the farm but there were
13:38
lots of grass because of which they
13:40
couldn't work properly. they looked
13:42
worried, then charles
13:44
burned the grass with his power.
13:46
and he helped those farmers.
13:49
after few days
13:50
rainy season arrived but there was no
13:53
sign of rain there.
13:55
the villagers were worried,
13:58
then paul used his power and there was
14:00
rain in the village.
14:02
seeing these things, the villagers were
14:04
very happy
14:06
and they got back to work.
14:08
this way these three friends helped
14:10
different people in different ways.
14:13
one day due to cylinder burst, there was
14:16
phrase fire in a house. this news spread
14:19
in the entire village and these friends
14:21
also came to know. then these three
14:23
friends started helping other people
14:25
also. with the help of joseph's power,
14:28
they flew and reached that place.
14:31
charles entered into the house because
14:33
fire would not do anything harm to him.
14:36
they entered into the house to rescue
14:38
the people trapped there, and paul went
14:41
with charles to help him extinguish the
14:43
fire in the house. then charles told paul
14:47

14:50

14:52

14:55
this house.
14:56

14:59
saying this both of them entered the
15:02
house.
15:03
the stuff in that house was burning.
15:05
then paul went there and poured water on
15:08
them.
15:14
charles rescued all the family members
15:16
out of the house. and they came out.

===============================================
16:44
in a village named stillok
16:46
there lived two former friends
16:50
who were wealthy
16:52
they had three farms each
16:54
they had so many cows and cattles
16:56
they were the richest farmers of the
16:58
village despite all the wealth they were
17:01
not happy they desired to increase their
17:04
wealth more and more except for these
17:06
two farmers there was another farmer in
17:09
the village who was poor he had only one
17:12
farm and a cow whom he used to love very
17:15
much
17:16
despite being poor he was very happy
17:19
and used to live his life peacefully
17:22
every night before going to sleep he
17:24
used to thank god
17:26
for whatever he has given him
17:28
the tourist farmer used to see that poor
17:31
farmer always happy seeing him this
17:34
happy they used to worry about
17:36
brother
17:38
despite of being a poor farmer how is he
17:40
so happy he isn't wealthy like us
17:43
neither he has farms and cattles like us
17:46
despite of that how he could be so happy
17:49
whenever they used to meet him they used
17:51
to make fun of him and his destitution
17:54
and used to show off their opulence
17:57
but the poor farmer remains calm
18:01
but none of this used to affect him
18:04
which made them even more furious
18:06
days passed like this
18:08
one day both of the rich farmers decided
18:11
to upset the poor farmer and visit to
18:13
that poor farmer they said
18:16
give us your cow and in return we will
18:19
give you 100 silver coins which is
18:21
enough for your cow the poor farmer
18:23
denied to sell his cow
18:25
as he was very affectionate about it
18:28
and he didn't want to sell his cow at
18:31
any cost
18:32
his denial to sell the cow didn't go
18:34
well with the rich farmers and the
18:36
thought of taking revenge
18:38
see how arrogant he is don't even listen
18:40
to us now wait and watch what we will do
18:43
to you
18:44
that night both the rich farmers went to
18:46
the poor farmer's farm
18:48
and set all his crops on fire
18:51
so that the poor farmer has to sell his
18:53
cow for money
18:55
the next morning when the poor farmer
18:57
woke up and went to his farm he started
19:00
crying seeing his farm in this condition
19:03
oh god i haven't done wrong to anyone
19:06
then why has someone burnt all my crops
19:08
what will i do now he was very upset and
19:11
came home all the way crying
19:14
now he was having cash crunch
19:16
and didn't had enough money to buy food
19:19
for his cow
19:21
seeing this the farmer said how will she
19:24
survive without food
19:26
it's better to sell her
19:28
at least somewhere someone will keep her
19:31
happy please forgive me for this i have
19:33
no other way
19:35
he decided to sell his cow
19:38
so he took it to another village
19:41
he also took 10 silver coins along with
19:44
him while crossing a forest on the way
19:47
he thought
19:48
if someone attacks and takes all the
19:51
silver coins from me
19:52
that's why he hides the bag of silver
19:55
coins
19:56
in the cow's bell collar
19:58
after walking all day
20:00
he felt tired
20:02
and thought of resting in a lodge
20:04
and he tied the cow with a poll of lord
20:08
and went inside suddenly a silver coin
20:11
dropped from the cow's bell collar which
20:14
the owner of the lodge noticed
20:17
i think it's a magical cow which gives
20:20
silver coins
20:22
maybe this silver has also come from
20:24
this cow when the poor farmer came
20:26
outside the lodge after resting the
20:29
owner of the lodge asked him hey mister
20:32
where are you going then the poor farmer
20:34
said
20:35
i am going to another village to sell my
20:37
car hearing this the owner of the lodge
20:40
became happy and he said you don't need
20:43
to go to another village
20:44
i'll buy you a cow
20:46
the honor of the lord gave the farmer 1
20:49
000 silver coin and asked him for his
20:52
cow the amount was much more than the
20:54
cow's actual price thinking this as
20:57
god's signal the farmer sold his cow to
20:59
the lodge honor
21:01
and happily returned to his village
21:03
after returning back home the farmer
21:06
started counting the silver coins when
21:08
suddenly the wealthy farmers came to
21:10
visit him and were surprised to see that
21:12
the poor farmer has one thousand silver
21:14
coins so they asked the poor farmer from
21:17
where did you get all these silver coins
21:19
then the poor farmer answered smiling i
21:22
have sold my cow and got these silver
21:25
coins in return
21:26
the wealthy farmers were upset thinking
21:28
that now the poor farmer will buy more
21:32
cattle with these coins
21:34
and will become wealthier than them
21:37
a bad deed has a bad result
